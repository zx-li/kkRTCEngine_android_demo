# janus-gateway-android
This is an API wrapper that utilizes the native WebRTC build and is made to ease communication with the [janus-gateway](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway)


This is a build in progess. It is designed to be similar to the [JavaScript API wrapper provided by meetecho](https://github.com/meetecho/janus-gateway/blob/master/html/janus.js).

Since this is in such early stages, any assistence and input is ***VERY*** welcomed.


Currently working examples:

 - EchoTest
 - VideoRoom
